# Design note:
# The only reason for importing zombie and normal is to allow the class queries
# for zombies, normals such as
#   zombie.Zombie.get_all_instances()
# 
# If we used the import form:
#   from zombie import Zombie
# we would say
#   Zombie.get_all_instances()
# but this won't work because circular references would be created among 
# the three subclasses Zombies, Normals, and Defenders.  That is, the three
# classes are co-dependent in that they need to know that each other exists.

# The proper solution is that zombie, normal, defender would all be placed
# in the same module file to achieve the co-dependencies without the import.  
# But we want them in different files for the tournament.  There is never
# a good pure solution in the real world.
